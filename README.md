### Inspiration

The inspiration and design idea of this project came from this [awesome CSS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R2E7O-Ngo). I built this project on my own and added a [modal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window) to the [contact page](https://little-taco-shop-project.netlify.app/contact.html) which pops up when the user submits the form. I used [Tailwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailwind_CSS) insted of [vanilla CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

### What I learnt

- How to use many typography properties like [`letter-spacing`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/letter-spacing), [`line-height`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/line-height) etc. in Tailwind
- Learnt a lot of things about [customizing and extending the theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) as per the project and design needs like extending `font-size`s, `max-width`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, `inset`, `scale`, `border-width`, `border-radius`, [colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), [spacing](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing) and many more.
- How to use [arbitrary properties in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#arbitrary-properties)
- How can we add a nice modal to our sites using the native [`dialog`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) HTML element
- How to submit forms on our websites with insane ease using [an amazing platform formsubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) without bothering to write any backend code.

### Useful Resources

1. [Official Tainwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/)
1. MDN has a [great and easy documentation for the native `dialog` HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) (as always ☺️).
1. [Kevin sir's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAB_v6yBXIE) can be useful if you wanna use the native `dialog` HTML element to make modals in your project.
1. [Formsubmit's docs](https://formsubmit.co/documentation) can be super useful if you wanna use some of the wonderful features they provide.
